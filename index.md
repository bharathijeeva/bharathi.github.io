I am Bharathi Kannan, a Ph.D. student in the department of physics at IISER Pune advised by M.S Santhanam.

Research Interest:

I work on the interplay between quantum physics and computer science (information theory, machine learning, complexity theory). Some problems I think about:

  How to learn and make predictions in a quantum-mechanical world?
  
 Could quantum machines learn faster and predict more accurately?
 
 How can machine learning advance quantum technology and fundamental physics?
 
 What are the fundamental limits in learning with classical and quantum machines?
